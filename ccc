**Subject:** JFrog Implementation Outline & Follow-Up Call  

Hi [Team],  

Based on the conversation I had with the contianers SMEs, I’m outlining below the key steps and changes we expect for the JFrog implementation. I want to ensure everyone, including [Manager’s Name] and [Architect’s Name], is aligned on the workflow before our official call next week.  

Additionally, I’d like to schedule a call tomorrow to discuss these steps in detail if you have availability. Please let me know your preferred time.  

### **JFrog Implementation Steps**  

#### **P1 Packaging:**  
1. Build Docker image.  
2. Perform AquaSec scan.  
3. **Push to JFrog snapshot repository** – This requires exploration of CLI vs API, understanding rate limits, and analyzing authentication mechanisms.  
4. Create application package.  

#### **P1 Deployment:**  
1. Pull the image from JFrog snapshot repo.  
2. Deploy using Helm charts.  

#### **Release Candidate Packaging:**  
1. Build Docker image.  
2. Perform AquaSec scan.  
3. Push to JFrog release repository.  
4. Pull the image from JFrog release repo with updated metadata.  
5. Perform another AquaSec scan.  
6. **Create release bundle and push to edge repositories** – A new step.  
7. Package the build.  

#### **P2 Deployment:**  
1. Pull the image from the release bundle.  
2. Perform AquaSec scan in fail-open mode.  
3. Deploy the image.  

### **Concerns and Timeline Challenges**  

Given the expected completion timeline of February, we foresee the following challenges, which require additional time:  
1. **API and CLI Exploration:** Understanding rate limits, edge repository availability, and authentication mechanisms.  
2. **Pipeline Configuration Schema:** Developing and validating operational use cases for JFrog workflows.  
3. **Application Onboarding Updates:** Updating onboarding steps to create JFrog repositories during setup.  
4. **Documentation:** Detailed guides for the entire workflow.  
5. **Knowledge Transfer (KT):** Training sessions for teams.  
6. **Release Process Validation:** Comprehensive testing of workflows for stability and readiness.  

**Estimated Timeline:** At least 3 months to complete all steps effectively.  

Let me know if tomorrow works for a detailed discussion or if there’s a better time.  

Thanks,  
[Your Name]
