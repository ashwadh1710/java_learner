Here’s a polished articulation of your use cases and the feedback functionality for your demo:

### **Showcasing Core Functionalities of the DDP Support Feature**

To demonstrate the real-life capabilities of the Smart Assistant’s **DDP Support Feature**, I’ve outlined several scenarios based on common challenges users face. These scenarios highlight how the assistant observes, identifies, and reacts to pipeline issues, ensuring users receive actionable insights and support.  

---

#### **Case 1: Success Case**
- The Smart Assistant confirms that the pipeline has executed successfully without any issues.  
- It provides users with detailed logs for verification and includes an option to create a **support ticket** if further assistance is required.  
- This ensures that even in success scenarios, users have a clear path for additional help if needed.  

---

#### **Case 2: Success with Deployment Issues**
- In some instances, pipelines may be marked as successful, but deployments fail due to underlying issues that are hard to identify.  
- The assistant processes the pipeline and deployment logs, identifies the root cause of the problem, and presents the relevant information to the user.  
- If needed, users can escalate the issue to the **DSO Customer Care Team** directly through the assistant for further investigation and resolution.  

---

#### **Case 3: Failure Scenario with Known Error Code**
- When the pipeline fails and the assistant detects a known error code from the predefined error catalog, it performs an in-depth analysis to pinpoint the root cause.  
- For eligible scenarios, it generates a **source code link** (e.g., a Bitbucket link) that directs the user to the exact line of code requiring attention.  
- This feature streamlines debugging and resolution for developers.  

---

#### **Case 4: Failure Scenario with Known Error Code (Non-Code Specific)**
- In some cases, a failure is associated with a known error code but does not warrant a source code link generation.  
- The assistant provides a detailed description and explanation of the issue, helping users understand the problem clearly.  
- This ensures users are equipped with actionable information, even when a direct fix isn’t applicable.  

---

#### **Case 5: Blackbox Failures**
- Occasionally, pipelines may fail due to complex or ambiguous issues that neither DDP nor the Smart Assistant can fully analyze.  
- In such cases, the assistant highlights the issue, provides as much detailed information as possible, and suggests reaching out to the **DSO Customer Care Team** for further support.  
- This ensures users always have a pathway to escalate unresolved problems.

---

### **Feedback Feature**
Before concluding any session, the Smart Assistant includes a **feedback mechanism** to gather valuable user insights.  
- At the end of each interaction, it prompts the user with a feedback question:  
  - “How would you rate your experience with the Smart Assistant today?”  
  - Users can provide feedback, which the assistant logs in the database for further analysis and improvements.  
- Additionally, the assistant logs user sessions in the database for **audit purposes**, helping maintain transparency and track usage patterns.

### **Conclusion**
The **DDP Support Feature** is designed to address a wide range of pipeline scenarios, ensuring users get the support they need—whether it’s detailed logs, actionable insights, or escalation options. With the added **feedback functionality**, the Smart Assistant continuously improves by learning from user experiences, creating a more efficient and user-friendly tool.  

This structure not only highlights the assistant’s capabilities but also demonstrates its commitment to evolving based on user needs and organizational requirements.
